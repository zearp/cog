# Cog Sparkle

This is an older version of Cog that still works great today on Ventura. It is a lot less bloaty and much faster than the current iteration. I have the source code in a backup somewhere for now I could only find the binary and old Cog build number. I might have to use the Wayback machine or something to find the actual source. Luckily it still works so doesn't need any changes.

I am a minimalist and the current version of Cog is really bloated to me and it just feels slow and cumbersome and also includes a colour scheme that seemingly can't be changed by the user and uses some orange and yellowish colours that imho look really ugly in macOS dark mode. This old version looks great in dark mode as it just uses a very simple black and white colour scheme.

I am sharing this like an archive for others who want to use Cog but not the new bloated version. Even when I find the source I am not going to develop it unless it breaks on a newer macOS version. The build I have is ```e8c6a00d9``` there might be newer builds within the Sparkle branch. If I find any that are newer I will test and add or replace the binary and also add the sources of any old builds I can find.

Screenshots below of the standard layout. This layout can be modified a bit to remove clutter from the user interface. I like to add a button in both normal and mini layout modes to switch between them with a simple mouse click.
